# Quadrant2Azimuth
Converts quadrant compass measurements to azimuth.
By: Scott D. Hull, Field Camp 2016 (yeah, I got the quadrant compass).

Boot up 'quad2azi.py' with Python 3.

Enter in a '.csv' file existing in the same directory as the python script at the prompt, formatted so that your quadrant measurements are in a single column, like in the following example:

N60W

S20E

N68E

The code will convert quadrant to azimuth notation and output a file called 'Quad2Azi_Out.csv', in which your quadrant measurements will be in the first column and the corresponding azimuth notation in the second.
